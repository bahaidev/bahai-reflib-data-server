# bahai-reflib-data-server

A Node.js Express service and web app for retrieving data out of the
[Bahá'í Reference Library](https://bahai.org/library).

Utilizes [bahai-reflib-data](https://github.com/brettz9/bahai-reflib-data) for
the data.

Note that although this uses data from the Bahá'í Reference Library, this is
just an individual effort not related to the site.

## To-dos

1. Link to web-service/web app once displayed

## Potential to-dos

1. Could make web app version which was entirely offline capable, using
    `bahai-reflib-data`'s browser build and a service worker.
