# bahai-reflib-data-server

A Node.js Express service and web app for retrieving data out of the
[Bahá'í Reference Library](https://bahai.org/library).

Utilizes [bahai-reflib-data](https://github.com/brettz9/bahai-reflib-data) for
the data.

Note that although this uses data from the Bahá'í Reference Library, this is
just an individual effort not related to the site.

## To-dos

1. Put online the **JSON service** (using, e.g., for Bahaipedia and Bahai9
    links) and link to it here
1. Put online as a **web app**, allowing a series of pull-downs for work,
    section, and paragraph number to get the ID and link, and link to it here.

## Potential to-dos

1. Could make web app version which was entirely offline capable, using
    `bahai-reflib-data`'s browser build and a service worker.
